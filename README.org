#+TITLE: My Blog
#+AUTHOR: Isaac Feldman

This is the repository for my personal website/blog.
I originally produced it by hand with HTML/CSS, but now that I need to add more posts I'm taking a different approach.

** The Stack:
- Emacs
  Emacs already is where I write everything, so I might as well use it to write blog posts
- Org-publish
  A way to export HTML directly from Emacs which people have found great success
- [[https:github.com/oxalorg/sakura][sakura.css]]
  a very nice CSS template

** MLP:
*** TODO Publishing
I want to be able to transform my notes into posts
*** TODO CV
I want to be able to maintain my CV on my site
